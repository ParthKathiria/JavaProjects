Projects programmed solely using the JAVA language:

Project-1: This project involves implementing a program to score a Cribbage hand by calculating points from various scoring categories (Pairs, Runs, Fifteen, Flush, and His Knobs) using a set of 4 cards and a communal starter card.

Project-2: This project involves designing and implementing a program in Java to help a warrior find the shortest path from an initial chamber to an exit chamber in a dungeon represented by hexagonal chambers using a priority queue. The program must navigate different types of chambers (empty, dragon, wall, and exit) while avoiding paths through or adjacent to dragon chambers.

Project-3: This project involves designing and implementing recursive algorithms in Java to print the structure of the file system on your computer. The task includes collecting file system information and storing it in a non-linear linked data structure, specifically using nodes that can reference multiple other nodes, similar to tree structures. When the Java files are run, a graphical user interface (GUI) is displayed to show the information of your file system visually.

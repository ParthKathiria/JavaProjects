# Overview

## Description: 

### Project-1
This project involves implementing a program to score a Cribbage hand by calculating points from various scoring categories (Pairs, Runs, Fifteen, Flush, and His Knobs) using a set of 4 cards and a communal starter card.

### Project-2
This project involves designing and implementing a program in Java to help a warrior find the shortest path from an initial chamber to an exit chamber in a dungeon represented by hexagonal chambers using a priority queue. The program must navigate different types of chambers (empty, dragon, wall, and exit) while avoiding paths through or adjacent to dragon chambers.

### Project-3
This project involves designing and implementing recursive algorithms in Java to print the structure of the file system on your computer. The task includes collecting file system information and storing it in a non-linear linked data structure, specifically using nodes that can reference multiple other nodes, similar to tree structures. When the Java files are run, a graphical user interface (GUI) is displayed to show the information of your file system visually.

### Project-4
This project involves writing part of a Java program to play the X+Game, where two players (a human and the computer) take turns placing tiles on an n x n board, aiming to form an X-shape or +shape with at least k tiles to win. The program evaluates possible plays using a recursive algorithm and a hash table to store and retrieve board configurations efficiently, and a graphical user interface (GUI) is provided to display the game board when the Java files are run.

### Project-5
This project involves implementing an ordered dictionary using a binary search tree (BST) along with a text-based user interface for managing and retrieving records. The main tasks include creating and manipulating data structures for storing keys and records, performing BST operations, and handling user commands for interacting with the dictionary.

### Project-6
This project involves writing a program to solve a maze represented as an undirected graph, where nodes correspond to rooms and edges to corridors or doors. The program will read a maze description from a file, use a specified number of coins to open doors, and output a path from the entrance to the exit, implementing a graph traversal algorithm such as a modified depth-first search (DFS).

Note: Every project is coded solely using Java.
